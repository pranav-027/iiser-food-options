    <h1>At IISER Pune, you have the following Food Options:</h1>
<h2><strong>1) Dining Hall Complex</strong></h2>
<p>IISER Pune has a Dining Hall which primarily serves its students. It is a 400 metre (~5 minutes) walk from the LHC (Lecture Hall Complex) </p>
<p>There are two food caterers here:</p>
<ul>
<li>V - Square (on Ground Floor)</li>
<li>Shivsagar (on First Floor)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both have a token-based system. You go to the counter, order your food by looking at the menu, and get your token.</p>
<p>The token is in the form of two paper pieces with the order details. You give one token piece at the food counter and give the other token piece when your food is ready.  </p>
<p>There&#39;s a readymade lunch menu at both the places. Both Vegetarian and Non-Vegetarian food options are there and have their special lines. These are usually faster and you don&#39;t need to wait much.</p>
<p>You can also get Soft Drinks, Packed Fruit Juices, etc.</p>
<p>Feel free to ask anyone around if you are confused. The students around would help you out. </p>
<h2><strong>2) Ordering Food Online</strong></h2>
<p>You can order food online from services like Zomato, Swiggy, Uber Eats, etc. directly at the LHC.</p>
<p>Just inform them that the delivery person should come to your location at the LHC. Don&#39;t forget to tell them that Helmets are compulsory inside the IISER Campus, or else two-wheelers won&#39;t be allowed. </p>
<p>Also, order some time before the Lunch Break starts, so you can get your food and have it comfortably during the break.</p>
